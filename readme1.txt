To my knowledge everything that we were expected to implement has been implemented.  At this time pp is being treated identically to p and c is not implemented.  Both of these are the result of a conversation I had with Professor Olano after class on Tuesday.  Everything should run using the make file that was provided.

I used the following sites to brush up on my C++ since it has been quite some time since I last wrote anything of significance in C++.

I also spoke briefly with a friend who is very good with Linear Algebra to diagnose a bug that I thought was an error in my math that later turned out to be the result of my reuse of an index variable that I had already used in an outer for loop.  No code was provided by him.  We simply discussed the math alone with me describing what I had done and he confirmed that it was doing what I thought it should be.
